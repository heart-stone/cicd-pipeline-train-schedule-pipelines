# cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-pipelines

This is a simple train schedule app written using nodejs. It is intended to be used as a sample application for a series of hands-on learning activities.

Oh and also...I edited this line to kick off the Jenkins pipeline :D

## Running the app

You need a Java JDK 7 or later to run the build. You can run the build like this:

    ./gradlew build

You can run the app with:

    ./gradlew npm_start

Once it is running, you can access it in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
